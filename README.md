# javascript-challenge

In this homework challenge, it was required to populate a table from a javascript Object. 

The code looked like this 


```javascript
var data = [{
    datetime: "1/1/2010",
    city: "benton",
    state: "ar",
    country: "us",
    shape: "circle",
    durationMinutes: "5 mins.",
    comments: "4 bright green circles high in the sky going in circles then one bright green light at my front door."
  },
...
in a repeating fashion (114 of them)
```

In the first folder, *UFO-level-1*, it contains the index.html file that can be loaded to view the example.  This code was completed using d3.  In */assets/js/app.js* there you will find the code that powers the selection and filtering.
